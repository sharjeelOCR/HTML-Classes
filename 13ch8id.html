    <h2>GIT Control</h2>
    <p id="git">You won't find a top programmer, web developer, or AI engineer who doesn't use version control. This is true because version control helps developers produce better results and makes collaboration easy. Around the world, in teams both large and small, Git is an essential part of the toolchain. This module covers Git and Github.</p>
    <h2>Object Oriented and Functional Programming using Python</h2>
    <p id="oop">In the second module of the program, students will learn about basic programming concepts such as lists, dictionaries, classes, functions and loops, and practice writing clean and readable code with exercises for each topic. Students will also learn how to make programs interactive and how to test code safely before adding it to a project. It is a fast-paced, thorough introduction to programming with Python 3.6 that will have students writing programs, solving problems, and making things that work in no time.</p>
